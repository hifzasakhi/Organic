			<h1>What are functional groups?</h1>
			<p>
			Functional groups are the sites of chemical reactivity in a molecule. It is at these locations that bonds are broken and formed. These sites are very useful for performing organic synthesis reactions to make useful substances as well for determining the reactivity of a molecule and the type of products that can result. We have listed the major functional groups below.    
			</p>
			<h2>Alkanes</h2>
			<p>
			Alkanes are the most saturated hydrocarbons and consist of only single bonds. Each carbon has four bonds, with each single bond being made only to another Carbon or Hydrogen atom. Alkanes have sp<sup>3</sup> hybridization and are typically inert. For this reason, alkanes are often reacted with Br<sub>2</sub> to convert them to alkyl halides and make them more useful for organic synthesis reactions.   
			</p>
			<h2>Alkenes</h2>
			<p>
			Alkanes are also hydrocarbons like alkanes, but the difference is that they consist of at least one double bond. Alkanes have sp<sup>2</sup> hybridization and are particularly reactive at the pi-system (double bond). Alkenes can be converted back to alkanes with a hydrogenation reaction or to alkynes using a double dehydrohalogenation reaction. The location of the double bond should be specified and given priority when naming, meaning it should have the lower number. 
			</p>
			<h2>Alkynes</h2>
			<p>
			Alkynes are also hydrocarbons like alkanes and alkenes and consist of atleast one triple bond. If this triple bond occurs at the end, the alkyne is referred to as a terminal alkyne and if the triple bond occurs in the middle of the chain, then it is an internal alkyne.  Alkanes have sp hybridization and are particularly reactive at the pi-system (triple bond). Alkynes can be converted back to alkenes (cis and trans types) as well as to alkanes. Abstracting a hydrogen from a terminal alkyne can be used for chain elongation reactions with alkyl halides. The location of the triple bond should be specified and given priority during naming, meaning it should have the lower number.  
			</p>
			<h2>Alcohols </h2>
			<p>
	        Alcohol is famous for containing an Oxygen atom attached to a Hydrogen (the -OH group) along with the usual Hydrogen and Carbon atoms. The alcohol group is notably reactive and can undergo many substitution reactions to become an alkyl halide. Likewise, the alcohol group can be oxidized into a ketone, aldehyde, or a carboxylic acid using the appropriate reagents. The alcohol group can also reduced with various reagents. In naming, the location of the -OH group should be mentioned and given the higher priority when naming.   
			</p>
			<h2>Alkyl Halides</h2>
			<p>
	        Alkyl halides are very reactive and are notably famous for containing halogen atoms along with the usual Hydrogen and Carbon. Alkyl halides are very reactive due to the presence of the halogen, which is a good leaving group. For this reason, they can undergo many reactions, including the two types of substitution reactions like S<sub>N</sub>1, S<sub>N</sub>2 as well as the elimination reactions like E1, and E2 to form an alkene. Alkanes are typically converted to alkyl halides to impart reactivity to them.  </p>
            <h2>Amines</h2>
            <p>
	         Amines are a unique variant of the hydrocarbon, because they contain a Nitrogen atom. This Nitrogen atom can be bonded to any combination of Carbon chains or Hydrogens, until the sum is equals to three. If Carbon chains are connected to the Nitrogen, their location is described by appending the letter N when specifying the location of the substituent. Amines can undergo many reactions to convert to other functional groups. They are also famous for undergoing the amine inversion. </p>
             <h2>Ketones</h2>
             <p>
	         Ketones have a carbonyl group, in which a Carbon atom is bonded to Carbon chains on two sides, and has a double bond with an Oxygen atom. After breaking off one of the Carbon chains, ketones can become oxidized to becomes carboxylic acids or can be reduced to become alcohols. The Carbon of the carbonyl group is also partially electropositive and can undergo nucleophilic attack by a more a negative species. During naming, the location of the carbonyl group has to be specified and given the highest priority.  </p>
             <h2>Aldehydes</h2>
             <p>Aldehydes are similar to ketones in that they have a carbonyl group. The difference comes from the fact that the double bonded Carbon is bounded to a Carbon chain on one side and at least one Hydrogen on the other side. An exception is formaldehyde, which has no Carbon chain, and instead has Hydrogens on both sides of the carbonyl Carbon. Aldehydes can become oxidized to becomes carboxylic acids or can be reduced to become alcohols. The Carbon of the carbonyl group is also partially electropositive and can undergo nucleophilic attack by a more a negative species.  
	         </p>
             <h2>Carboxylic Acids</h2>
             <p>As their name implies, carboxylic acids result from a combination of a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group. Although carboxylic acids are one of the most oxidized species, under certain circumstances, they can undergo the last oxidation step to become Carbon Dioxide gas which will be given off. Carboxylic acids can turn into esters and amides by a special nucleophilic reaction. They can also be reduced to becomes aldehdes, ketones, and alcohols. They have the highest priority of all the organic functional groups and the Carbon bearing the bonds to Oxygen is counted as carbon 1.  
	         </p>
             <h2>Amides</h2>
             <p> Amides are a combination of a carbonyl group and an amine. They have special properties due to the Nitrogen and the Oxygen atom in the structure. Amides are the least reactive of the carboxylic acid derivatives. They can undergo an acid catalysed hydration reaction. For naming purposes, the carbonyl Carbon is given the position 1.
	         </p>
	         <h2>Esters</h2>
             <p>Esters are another group of carboxylic acid derivative. Though not quite as reactive as a carboxylic acid, they can still be converted into amides as well as the carboxylate ion.  They can also undergo the saponification reaction, which is important for making soaps and detergents. Plus, they react with the Grignard Reagent to form special compounds.  
	         </p>
	         <h2>Ethers</h2>
             <p>Ethers can be though of as two Carbon chains appended on both sides of an Oxygen atom. Ethers are notable for being used as organic solvents because they can undego numerous substitution and elimination reactions. Solvents like Dimethyl Ether are often used in Organic Chemistry labs when organic solvents are needed. 
	         </p>
	         <h2>Nitriles</h2>
             <p>Nitriles are famous for containing the cyano group (-CN group), which is a Carbon triple bonded to Nitrogen. Nitriles are very reactive. In fact, their reactivity is similar to that of the carbonyl group. For this reason, they can undergo nucleophilic addition reactions in addition to nucleophilic acyl substitution reactions. The Carbon of the cyano group is used during the naming scheme and the word nitrile is appended at the end when naming these compounds. Ex: Ethanenitrile.
