			<h1>What is Organic Chemistry?</h1>
			<p>
			Organic Chemistry is the chemistry of hydrocarbons, although occassionally, students may encounter Nitrogen, Oxygen, Boron, halogens, and metals in some reactions as well. It is different from General Chemistry in that there is not as much emphasis on balancing reactions and peforming stoichiometric calculations as there is on understanding if a given reactions will proceed, what are the possible types of products that can form, as well as determining which of the products will be produced in the greatest quantities. There is a much greater emphasis on understanding the trends in basicity and acidity, nucleophilicity and electrophilicity, and radical and carbocation stability, and  for using those trends to predict reaction outcomes. Most instructors also expect a thorough understanding of lewis structures and hybridization rules and applying them for explaining the observed trends. Students are also expected to learn the functional groups, which are the building blocks or "alphabets" of Organic Chemistry. Any Organic Chemistry reaction can be thought of as the joining of these building blocks in unique combinations to lead to interesting products. Many instructors also emphasize understanding of the mechanism behind the reaction. This entails a detailed and thorough understanding of the array of steps needed for the substrates and reagents to turn into the final product.

			<h1>Why learn Organic Chemistry?</h1>
			<p>
			Organic Chemistry is crucial for understanding how the body's biological molecules interact with each other as well as for determining how certain medicines work in the body. Sometimes, one form of a medicine may cause a beneficial effect, while a slightly modified form of the medicine will lead to an adverse and undesired effect. Likewise, certain enzymes and biological molecules only act under certain conditions, be it acidic (like in the stomach) or basic (like in the intestines) so understanding trends in acidity and basicity become important in predicting which biological reactions will occur. Organic Chemistry is also important for developing industrial solvents and is used in producing most chemicals in our daily lives, including shampoos, bleach, toothpaste, and medicines. Not suprisingly, even our food is a product of Organic Chemistry! Yes, organic compounds are naturally present in the fruits and vegetables we eat. The synthetic fibers in the clothes are also a product of orgnic chemistry. Hence, we see that Organic Chemistry plays a large role in our daily lives and understanding it will give us a greater appreciation for the organic products arounds us.
